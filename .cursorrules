You are an expert in game development specifically Godot using GDScript.

Key Principles
- Write clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
- Use GDScript features to their fullest extent.
- Optimize performance and memory usage.
- Follow best practices for game development.

Project Setup
- Directory Structure:
    - Keep the project folder structured for clarity and reusability.
    - /project
        - /assets          # Art, sound, and other external assets
  │    ├── /sprites
  │    ├── /audio
  │    └── /fonts
  ├── /scenes          # Game scenes
  ├── /scripts         # GDScript files
  │    ├── /actors     # Player, NPCs, and enemies
  │    ├── /ui         # User interface scripts
  │    └── /systems    # Game systems like inventory or saving
  ├── /resources       # Configurations and reusable resources
  ├── /tilesets        # Tilesets and tilemaps
  ├── /shaders         # Custom shaders
  └── /addons   
       # Third-party plugins or addons
Naming Conventions:
- Use clear, consistent naming for files, nodes, and scripts:
- Scripts: Use PascalCase, e.g., Player.gd
- Nodes: Use snake_case, e.g., player_sprite
- Scenes: Prefix by type, e.g., UI_Menu.tscn, Level_01.tscn
- Constants: Use ALL_CAPS, e.g., const MAX_HEALTH = 100

Node Organization
- Tree Hierarchy:
    - Group related nodes logically. Avoid deep nesting (more than 4-5 levels).
- One Scene, One Responsibility:
    - Each scene should handle one responsibility, such as:
        - Player.tscn: Handles player logic.
        - Enemy.tscn: Handles enemy behavior.
        - MainMenu.tscn: Handles the title screen UI.

Coding Standards
- General Guidelines:
    - Stick to GDScript as the primary language (if your project doesn't demand C# or other languages).
    - Keep functions short and focused (preferably under 20 lines).
    - Use comments sparingly but effectively

Script Structure:
- Organize scripts by:
    - Signals (at the top).
    - Constants.
    - Variables.
    - Functions.

Static Typing: 
- Use explicit types to prevent bugs and improve editor hints.
Singletons (Autoloads): 
- Use singletons for shared systems like:
    - Game state
    - Audio manager
    - Save system

Game Workflow
- Signals for Communication:
    - Use signals to decouple nodes. Avoid calling methods on other nodes directly.
    - Use custom resources for structured, reusable data:
- Debug Tools:
    - Use debug labels or breakpoints for testing.
    - Toggle debug features with environment variables or a debug flag:

Art and UI
- 2D Pixel Art:
    - Use CanvasItem scaling and rounding settings to prevent blurriness.
    - Set Project Settings > Display > Window > Stretch to 2d for pixel-perfect scaling.
- UI Standards:
    - Use Containers for UI layouts:
    - HBoxContainer, VBoxContainer, and GridContainer.
    - Anchor UI nodes to appropriate corners or centers for responsive layouts.

Performance
- Optimize Physics:
    - Use StaticBody2D for non-moving objects and Area2D for triggers.
    - Keep collision shapes simple.
- Load Scenes Dynamically:
    - Use PackedScene and instance scenes at runtime for memory efficiency:
- Use Groups:
        - Organize nodes with groups for batch operations:
